Below outlines a proposed design for the Pollster system. The goal is to build a scalable, real-time polling system that can smoothly handle millions of users, even when polls go viral.

### Assumptions

1. **Frontend is out of scope**  
    Assume a frontend (e.g. SPA or mobile app) exists and will integrate with the backend, but its implementation is not part of this design.
    
2. **Authentication is handled**  
    User sign-up, login, and authentication are already implemented and functional.
    
3. **Security is out of scope**  
    While security is important, detailed security considerations are outside the scope of this document.

## ‚úÖ Overview of System Requirements

- Immutable polls with multiple-choice questions
    
- Real-time updates of aggregated poll results
    
- High scalability and durability
    
- Fault tolerance and extensibility
    

### Background Tasks

- Send milestone notifications
    
- Periodic archival

## Data Estimates

Here's a quick, informal calculation to understand Pollster‚Äôs performance, scale, and infrastructure requirements.

### Assumptions

- **Active polls at peak:** 100 polls
    
- **Votes per second per poll:** 10 votes/sec
    
- **Active concurrent viewers per poll:** ~10,000 users
    

### Analysis

#### üìä Vote Write Throughput

- `100 polls √ó 10 votes/sec per poll = 1,000 votes/sec`
    

#### üìä Data Ingestion (Database Storage)

- **Per second:** `1,000 votes/sec √ó 226 bytes (estimated key size) ‚âà 226 KB/sec`
    
- **Per day:** `226 KB/sec √ó 86,400 sec/day ‚âà 19.5 GB/day`
    

#### üìä Redis Streams & Hashes

- **Redis Streams Throughput:**
    
    - 1,000 events/sec (votes) are easily handled by Redis ([>10K ops/sec](https://devopedia.org/redis-streams#qst-ans-7))
        
- **Redis Hash Memory Usage:**
    
    - `46 bytes (estimated key size) + 8 bytes (integer value) ‚âà 54 bytes per choice entry`
        
    - `(100 polls √ó 5 choices/poll) √ó 54 bytes ‚âà 27 KB total` (negligible)
        

---

## üóÑÔ∏èDatabase Design (PostgreSQL)

PostgreSQL is a great initial choice for Pollster because:

- Widely adopted across many enterprises and startups
    
- Great documentation and active community
    
- Natural fit for modeling structured relationships (polls, questions, choices)
    
- Strong ACID guarantees for consistency and auditability
    
- Built-in scalability features (partitioning, indexing)

#### NOSQL vs Relational

I did not suggest NoSQL because the data is relational ‚Äî polls have questions, questions have choices, and responses tie it all together. It‚Äôs easier and safer to manage that kind of structure in a relational database, and we get things like consistency, joins, and reliable queries out of the box with PostgreSQL.

### üìå Table Schema

```plantuml
@startuml
!define primary_key(x) <b>x</b>
!define foreign_key(x) <i>x</i>

entity "polls" {
    primary_key(poll_id): UUID
    creator_id: UUID
    title: TEXT
    description: TEXT
    created_at: TIMESTAMP
    closed_at: TIMESTAMP
    unique_slug: TEXT
}

entity "questions" {
    primary_key(question_id): UUID
    foreign_key(poll_id): UUID
    question_text: TEXT
    "order": INTEGER
}

entity "choices" {
    primary_key(choice_id): UUID
    foreign_key(question_id): UUID
    choice_text: TEXT
}

entity "responses" {
    primary_key(response_id): UUID
    foreign_key(question_id): UUID
    foreign_key(choice_id): UUID
    user_id: UUID
    submitted_at: TIMESTAMP
    ip_address: TEXT
}

' Relationships
polls ||--o{ questions : has
questions ||--o{ choices : has
questions ||--o{ responses : receives
choices ||--o{ responses : selected_by
polls ||--o{ responses : records
@enduml

```

### üìå Polls Table

```plantuml
@startuml

entity "polls" as polls {
    *poll_id: UUID <<PK>> -- Unique poll identifier
    creator_id: UUID -- ID of poll creator
    title: TEXT -- Title of the poll
    description: TEXT -- Optional description
    created_at: TIMESTAMP -- When the poll was created
    closed_at: TIMESTAMP -- When the poll was closed (nullable)
    unique_slug: TEXT -- URL-friendly unique identifier
}
@enduml

```

Holds high-level metadata about each poll. Polls are immutable after creation, except for their `closed_at` field. The field `unique_slug` will allow unique URL lookups to satisfy our requirements. 

### üìå Questions Table

```plantuml
@startuml

entity "questions" as questions {
    *question_id: UUID <<PK>> -- Unique question ID
    poll_id: UUID <<FK>> -- Refers to parent poll
    question_text: TEXT -- Text of the question
    order: INTEGER -- Display order (optional)
}

@enduml

```

Each poll can have multiple questions which allows flexibility for future multi-question polls.

### üìå Choices Table

```plantuml
@startuml

entity "choices" as choices {
    *choice_id: UUID <<PK>> -- Unique choice ID
    question_id: UUID <<FK>> -- Associated question
    choice_text: TEXT -- The actual choice label
}

@enduml

```

Holds the predefined answers for each question. Users can select from these during voting.

### üìå Responses Table

```plantuml
@startuml

entity "responses" as responses {
    *response_id: UUID <<PK>> -- Unique vote ID
    question_id: UUID <<FK>> -- Question being answered
    choice_id: UUID <<FK>> -- Selected choice
    user_id: UUID -- Optional if anonymous
    submitted_at: TIMESTAMP -- Time vote was submitted
}

@enduml

```

Stores every individual vote submitted by users. Acts as a durable audit trail for aggregation and analytics. Add constraints in the table to ensure a user has only voted on a question once.

## ‚ö°Redis

Reliable, asynchronous vote event processing:

- Sharded streams for horizontal scalability
    
- Ordered vote handling ensures accurate processing
    
- Redis Streams can handle thousands of events/sec

Pollster should use Redis to handle the real-time side of voting. Streams let us queue incoming vote events for workers to process reliably, hashes track live vote counts so we can read them super fast, and pub/sub pushes updates out to WebSocket servers instantly. It keeps things fast and responsive, and it separates real-time concerns from our database, which helps with scale and resilience.

#### üßµ Votes

**Key Format:** `poll:votes:stream-{shard_id}`

**Example Event:**

```json
{
  "poll_id": "abc123",
  "question_id": "456",
  "choice_id": "789",
}
```
#### üßµ Milestone Calculation

**Key Format:** `milestone:stream-{shard_id}`

**Example Event:**

```json
{
  "poll_id": "abc123",
  "total_votes": 10000
}
```
#### üßµ Notify  

**Key Format:** `notify:stream-{shard_id}`

**Example Event:**

```json
{
  "poll_id": "abc123",
  "type": "milestone",
  "recipient_id": "user-456",
  "message": "Your poll just hit 10,000 votes!"
}
```

#### üßµ Archival 

**Key Format:** `archival:stream-{shard_id}`

**Example Event:**

```json
{
  "poll_id": "abc123",
  "event": "poll_closed",
  "closed_at": "2025-03-27T20:00:00Z"
}
```


#### üßÆ Redis Hash (Aggregates)

- Atomic counters for real-time vote totals
    
- Ultra-fast updates, even under heavy load
    

**Key Format:** `poll:{poll_id}:counts`

**Example:**

```json
{
  "choice:789": 1540,
  "choice:790": 1200,
  "choice:791": 230
}
```


#### üì® Redis Pub/Sub Channel

- Efficiently notifies WebSocket nodes
    
- Enables real-time updates without DB polling
    

**Channel Name:** `poll:{poll_id}:updates`

**Example Message:**

```json
{
  "poll_id": "123",
  "results": {
    "choice:789": 1540,
    "choice:790": 1200,
    "choice:791": 230
  }
}
```

Pub/Sub enables stateless communication for websockets which helps in horizontally scaling the service with increased demand.

## Architecture Diagram

### üê¶ Bird's-eye View

Pollster is built for high-scale, real-time polling. Users vote and view results in a web app. Votes stream through Redis, are processed by workers, stored in PostgreSQL, and broadcast in real time via WebSockets.


```plantuml
@startuml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml

Rel(backend, data, "Reads/writes data")
Rel(backend, workers, "Dispatches background tasks")
Rel(workers, data, "Processes votes and poll results")

@enduml

```

### üîç Detailed View


Everything is stateless, message-driven, and horizontally scalable. Redis is split by concern, and worker pools make ingestion and background jobs resilient under load.

**Stateless frontend & backend:**      
    Both the API server and WebSocket gateway are stateless, which means we can scale them horizontally behind load balancers. Spin up more instances, and they just work ‚Äî no sticky sessions or shared memory to worry about. When traffic spikes (say, a poll goes viral), a load balancer can route requests to any healthy instance.
    
- **Real-time updates via Pub/Sub:**  
    
    WebSocket servers subscribe to Redis Pub/Sub channels. When a vote gets processed, an update is published and all the WebSocket servers get it ‚Äî simple and efficient. No polling or DB hits from the client side.
    
    
- **Redis roles:**  
    Redis is used in three different contexts. Each are logically separate and, from the infrastructure perspective we can scale or shard each independently as traffic grows:
    - **Streams** for ingesting raw vote events
    - **Hashes** for keeping live aggregated counts
    - **Pub/Sub** for broadcasting updates  
    
    
- **Parallel worker processing:**  
    Aggregator workers read from Redis Streams using consumer groups ‚Äî so we can run multiple in parallel to handle vote spikes. Background workers (like for archival or milestone notifications) scale separately too.


### Session Diagrams

#### üìñ Reading Votes

Below is a proposed workflow for users reading real-time votes.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber

actor Client as "Client App"

box "Application Tier"
  participant LB as "Load Balancer"
  participant API as "API Server"
end box

box "Redis Infrastructure"
  participant RedisCache as "Redis Aggregates"
end box

participant DB as "PostgreSQL"

== Client reads poll ==
Client -> LB : Request poll and vote results
LB -> API : Forward request

== Check vote counts ==
API -> RedisCache : Fetch aggregated vote counts
alt Cache miss
  API -> DB : Query vote counts from DB
  API -> RedisCache : Cache vote counts
end

== Check poll metadata ==
API -> RedisCache : Fetch poll metadata
alt Cache miss
  API -> DB : Query poll metadata from DB
  API -> RedisCache : Cache poll metadata
end

== Respond to client ==
API -> LB : Return response
LB -> Client : Return poll metadata and vote results

#### üó≥Ô∏è Submit Vote

Below is a proposed workflow for users to submit votes.

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber

actor ReactApp as "Client App"

box "Application Tier"
  participant LB as "Load Balancer"
  participant API as "API Server"
  participant WS as "WebSocket Gateway"
end box

box "Redis Infrastructure"
  participant RedisStreams as "Redis Streams"

  participant RedisPubSub as "Redis Pub/Sub"
end box

box "Backend Workers"
  participant Aggregator as "Aggregator Worker"
  participant Milestone as "Milestone Worker"
end box

participant DB as "PostgreSQL"

== Client submits a vote ==
ReactApp -> LB : Connect (HTTPS / WebSocket)
LB -> API : Forward vote request
API -> RedisStreams : Enqueue vote event
WS -> RedisPubSub : Subscribe to updates
API -> LB : Return success
LB -> ReactApp : Success response



== Vote processing ==
Aggregator -> RedisStreams : Consume vote event
Aggregator -> DB : Store vote
Aggregator -> RedisCache : Update vote count

    Aggregator -> RedisPubSub : Publish live vote update
    RedisPubSub -> WS : Deliver vote update
    WS -> ReactApp : Push vote count update

par Milestone check (Async Task)
    Aggregator -> RedisStreams : Enqueue milestone check
    Milestone -> RedisStreams : Consume milestone task
    Milestone -> RedisStreams : Enqueue notification task
end

@enduml

```

## üí° Future Thoughts

One thing I‚Äôd recommend exploring is change data capture (CDC) from PostgreSQL to Redis. Right now, we're writing to both systems ‚Äî the database for durability, and Redis for real-time aggregation ‚Äî which creates a dual write situation. That opens the door to inconsistencies if one write succeeds and the other fails. With CDC, we‚Äôd treat PostgreSQL as the single source of truth and stream inserts or updates directly into Redis. This removes the need for application-level dual writes and simplifies our logic. It also guarantees Redis stays consistent with what's actually stored in the database, which is a big win for correctness ‚Äî especially as we scale. Additionally, I did not account for partitioning the database, autoscaling, or consider replication. This would greatly improve our reliability on the PostgreSQL-side of things. Cloudflare could be a nice additional layer of security - [they are a trusted and reliable solution for ingress traffic](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/ddos-for-web/) within the Pollster network.

We could also expand our user tracking to support more personalized notifications ‚Äî for example, sending nudges to users who haven‚Äôt voted in a while, or generating daily or weekly digests that highlight polls they‚Äôve created or engaged with. These types of triggers would run as background jobs and push events into the same notification stream, so the notification system stays decoupled but flexible.
